-got pushbullet
-installed bash script in rpi to send ip address through pushbullet
-automated pushbullet script to run on startup
-connected / tested rpi camera
-posted message and picture to twitter
-imgur API

March 29, 2015
-had some problems with unreliable usb cables
-installed / started using git to back up rpi scripts *can put API keys in here :D*
-create imgur account - test again to make sure everything works with the access codes
-gpio pins
	-note that the T-cobbler must be installed in such an orientation so the white stripe on the wires is on the side closest to the SD card
	-connected led to see if it would work..
	-got stevens switchy thing to work
-milestone: switch->camera->imgur

-we wrote stuff. yay

March 31, 2015 (Anthony not here)
-research for power saving
-organized / wrote rpi game plan
-organized python files and wrote README.txt
-changed /boot/config.txt file so red rpi camera LED does not turn on
http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/05/how-to-disable-the-red-led-on-the-pi-camera-module/

-underclocking - considered this in order to save power when in image mode. However, I found out that most of the power demand is actually from the USB ports. Aditionally, changing the ARM frequency must be done in config.txt which would require a reboot / we cant really do manually.
There is an "on demand" CPU feature however that adjusts the CPU frequency depending on how busy it is. I set this for good measure. Might help a little..
See the Power Saving section of this document:
http://wiki.stocksy.co.uk/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Setup#Performance_or_Power_Saving

and then I currupted everything.. note to self always use shutdown commands :/
-back to square 1..

-hooked up level convertor with Diksha to be used for for arduino to rpi communication to make sure we don't break things with voltage. http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/txb0108.pdf

-fixed everything from before corruption / added usb shutdown scripts (needs testing for tomorrow)

*ALWAYS USE THE SHUTDOWN COMMANDS*
sudo shutdown -h now

April 1, 2015
-tested imageMode and USB hub shutdown from yesterday. We found out the USB hub will turn on automatically on restart.
-got arduino communication working http://blog.oscarliang.net/raspberry-pi-and-arduino-connected-serial-gpio/
python serial - http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/
-had problems with camera.. and ip address is not accurate
-anthony working for a bit on making ip address getting more accurate?

April 2, 2015
-started getting ip address from curlmyip.com to increase reliability
-add timer and shutdown command to main_images http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13293269/how-would-i-stop-a-while-loop-after-some-amount-of-time
-finished writing main switch script (needs testing)

-abandoning imgur for now :( went with ftp idea..
-get list of files from specified directory (local) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3207219/how-to-list-all-files-of-a-directory-in-python
https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html

-finished main_weatherStation with image handling and twitter - tomorrow weather data processing!

April 3, 2015
-integration with Steven and Logan and get all software / hardware ready for Wednesday
-documentation and code commmenting at some point..
