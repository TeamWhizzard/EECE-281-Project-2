Rasberry Pi!

Broadcom BCM2835 system-on-ship (SoC) multimedia processor

ARM11 instruction set - this is how processor is able to function at such low power / doesnt need a heat sink - means that rpi is not compatible with PC software which is built with x86 architectures in mind
ARM11 is designed around instruction set architecture ARMv6 - this means its also not compatible with software developed for ARMv7

(differences between x86 and arm? how does this relate to Arduino?)

RPi runs GNU / Linux

computer USB's cannot supply enough power? - starts running when power is connected, can only be turned off when it is disconnected

Linux - debian recommended because its lightweight - the rasberry pi image includes only a subset of the full software

load GUI: startx <enter>

*use nonprivilaged user account to protect against messing things up, and the internet downloading bad things..
emergency kernal (non-default) - used when the normal kernal isn't working

*many problems can be traced to inadequete power supply!!  model B takes 5V and 700mA?

WARNING: avoid touching test probes to anything not labelled as a test point - its possible to bridge 5V supply to internal 3.3V which could damage device :(

Boot diagnostics - most common cause of boot fail is a problem with the SD card
